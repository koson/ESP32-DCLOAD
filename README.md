These files relate to a project to be published in Silicon Chip magazine during 2022, and the project will be populated close to the publication date.

Only compiled code is provided for 2.8" and 3.5" versions (ILI9341 and ILI9488 LCD controllers) because the number of libraries and complexity of code would make it difficult for others to get a clean compile.

The Laser_Templates folder has SVG files for the front panel of the load. 

The front panel was cut from 2mm acrylic, and the support back panel from 3mm acrylic.

The laser templates are designed for a 270mm x 210mm x 140mm blue metal enclosureavailable from eBay, Banggood and AliExpress. The templates have been tested with LightBurn, but should work with other laser cutter software.

The front panel was made with clear acrylic, coated on the BACK with black spray paint. Wood filler, in a contrasting colour, was squeegeed into the etched labels and then polished off with very fine DRY sandpaper (600 grit). A final coat of clear spray was then appled to seal the wood filler and restore a gloss finish to the acrylic.
